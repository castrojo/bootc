# bootc Adopters (indirect, via ostree)

Bootc is a relatively new project, but much of the underlying technology and goals is *not* new.
The underlying ostree project is over 13 years old (as of 2024). This project also relates
to [rpm-ostree](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/) which has existed a really long time.

Not every one of these projects uses bootc directly today, but a toplevel goal of bootc
is to be the successor to ostree, and it is our aim to seamlessly carry forward these users.
